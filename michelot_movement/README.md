## Analysing animal movement data in R

This webinar will focus on one main theme: using location (long-lat) data to learn about animals' behaviour. In particular, we will discuss how hidden Markov models (HMMs) can be used to draw inferences about the behavioural state process underlying observed movement patterns. The outcomes of an HMM analysis include movement parameters (such as mean step length) for each behavioural state, as well as an estimated state for each time of observation. It is also possible to estimate the effect of covariates (e.g., temperature, bathymetry) on the behavioural dynamics of the animal, which is often of great ecological interest. We will illustrate the application of this method with the R package momentuHMM, and discuss common practical challenges with model fitting. A secondary theme of this webinar will be the filtering and regularisation of animal tracking data. HMMs assume that animal locations are observed at regular time intervals and with no error. When this assumption is not satisfied, a two-stage approach is typically applied, and we will demonstrate this using the packages foieGras and crawl.
